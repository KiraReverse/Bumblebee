hi youtube. 

MapleStory Guide on pre-leveling your Union Artifact NOW!! using autoclicker bot

ok. 

run the bot. 

go to 5th tab (Autoclicker). 

go to shop. 

click consumable. 

exit shop. 

return to farm. 

click decorate farm. see your cgradebox slot. 

mine is 2. 

fill in which monster slot to discharge. i will discharge 6th. 

finally, type in how many monster to discharge per loop. 

i have 27 monster slot, i start from 6th, so 21. should be. 

idk my math is bad.  

remember click 'set all variable to current value'. 

now all is set!

just click autoclicker GO! 

and sit back. 

relax. 

'esc' key is the fail safe. in case your mouse don't listen to you. 

if your mouse not moving, like mine, go to first tab. 

click rebind mouse. 

then click test mouse. 

ok now if the mouse move in a diamond shape, means it is binded. 

now let's go again. 

the quest is annoying. 

restart. 

ok it is bad. let me change the code a lil bit. 

ok let's test again. 


XXXXXDDXXXXXXDXX WHERE IS THE RIGHT CLICK!?!?!?

hold

ok we need to press enter one more time at the end of purchasing cgrade mob box. 

ok hopefully last fix. 

let's wait a bit at the end there and press enter. 

ok. final run????????

ok i think it is stable enough to run for long hours. 

has to slow down a bit and press enter multiple times due to server lag. 

last thing to add before wrap up, we need to click buy cgrade mob box more. to make it x99. 

that should be it. 

thank you guys for watching. 

have fun.
