hi youtube. 

this video will show you how to use the recording function. 

first, let me introduce some basics. 

for example this is a 1.9438second script, it presses f n times .. 

click on sonic to play. 

ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff

click on tails to pause. 

and click on knuckles to stop. 

now let's create a new script.. 

ok. 

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

ok, i downloaded this input overlay. 

now let's record a flash jump action. 

well the input overlay isnt working when i record omg

nvm, we fix that another day.. 

okay. simple  flash jump. we press save all. 

then we just playback. 

ok simple as that. 

now. we want to do 1 rotation. then, we come back to this  point. 

ok this point. now we press set point A here. 

press save all.. 

ok. now let's record the full rotation. 

i forgot to mention. 

when you are at this point A, press 'f9' on your keyboard. 

you will know why later. 

ok press save all. then run. 

stop the previous script first. 

ok play. 

see that 'f9'

when 'f9' key is read, it will walk your character back to point A. 

so let say now i am totally out of position.. 

ok restart. idk what happened. 

ok there is some bug when i press the pause button. 

i wil fix that later. 

thank you for watching this short tutorial.
