hi. 
welcome to the new event mapril island. 
there is this minigame that can farm attendance relatively fast. 
can my bumblebee bot auto clear the minigame?
let's find out!
the game rule is simple. 
just jump/duck to avoid the rock. 

first let's create a new class 'shadower'. 
because we don't have it yet. 
now add that class entry to character.py. 
done. now we have a new entry. 

ok. now let's code the simple random jump/duck rotation script. 
we can remove all previous rotation if it looks messy. 
ok. 
let's clean up the functions at the bottom of the file. 
let's remove the zero attacks. 
remove soul master. 
hmm .. let's remove adele too. 

ok we done cleaning up. 
now let's code our easy jump/duck rotation. 
we can just copy this random function. 
then we code our jump/duck function. 

check if we have it already in our base class action.py. 
nope! now let's add that two. 
we just add directly below. 

do the same for downpr(). 
ok, we actually need to duck longer instead of just pressing down down. 
let's create a seperate function for that. 

actually just pass the lower bound and upper bound of how much time you want to sleep. 
let say we press down for minimum .888 seconds and maximum 1.222 seconds. 
done. 
for testing purpose, lets sleep .5 seconds.

now we done with our code, let see if it works!

ops .. forgot to add an entry to our new function. 

let just try it here without going in to the minigame first. 

my jump key is c. 

it looks ok. let see the action in minigame! 

as you can see, it doesnt work, and i played badly. 

but still win, lol. 

ok it was because we not detecting player on minimap. 
cause in minigame, minimap is disabled.. 

lets fix that!

just temporarily disable the if x==None and move 
await self.character.perform_next_attack(x,y)
to the if statement. 

now let's try again. 

ohmygod it works!
it doesn't trigger the in-game afk-detector. 

next video, let's improve our bot with image detection/rock detection. 

thankss for watching!
