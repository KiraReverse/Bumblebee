hello youtube. 

enjoy my python programming timelapse. 

today we are coding our tab4: autoclicker. 

because in about one month time, monster life is gonna be removed. 

let's level up our monster life using bot!!!!

timelapse starto. 



naisu. 

our first button. 

ok. so theres a few coordinates to click. 







im not sure about the library. so im gonna test it. 
chatgpt lying to me =(
i dont trust chatgpt already. lets google. 
stackoverflow is better =))
i cant exit the program ..
i think that 2 line should be in the esc 
but let's just try chatgpt answer first ..
yep .. doesn't work. 
oh wtff
ok let me do more research and testing.. i pause recording now.. 
ok here's how you do it. 
you add a keyboard listener. 
ok just like that. 
now we want to get maplestory window, and we minus that. 
ok we just copy this code. 
alright! all set. 
now let's get those coordinates. 

x0=-1882 y0=23 # this our maple window 0,0
x=-1804 y=311 # this be our offset
x0-x=-78 y0-y=-288 # this should be the other way round

- auto take care = 77,292

- my monster = 69,665
- right click monster = 155 243 312 377 456 539,726
- discharge = 155 243 312 377 456 539,597
- the tick --> press enter = 492,453

- decorate farm = 154,669
- c box --> enter --> enter = 136 199 277 350 419,719
- shop = 878,760
- buy --> enter --> enter = 697,418
- return to farm = 996,754

alright! we got all offset! now let's code our autoclicker!
ok first, get maple coordinate. 
ok. 
alright! we got our SOP!
now code in the coordinates. 
now, we bring in our human-like mouse cursor!
now shall we test?
i have no idea what gonna happen. 
yay of course. 
XXXXDDXXDDXXDXXXXXDX
okok  we need a failsafe. 
let's code our failsafe now. 
this is similar to record function in tab2. 
we have a keyboard listener .. until esc is pressed. (failsafe)
ok i not sure how this work, need test. 
idk what am i doing but let's go. 
i still dk what am i doing but let's try. 
no idea. 
don't do this at home. 
very dangerous. 
no idea. =)
debugging ...
i still can't see the logic error. 
ok guys i found it WTF ..
now add a forever loop. 
isn't it cool. 
=)
another account. 
forgot to change slot. 
fuck. 
myfuckinggodquest. 
i hate this game. 
i hate this game. 
ok this is very good. 
next we want to change those value to variables. 
ok check if any error. 
ok this is good enough. 
now we create the GUI for user to enter those variables. 
GUI programming is the worst. 
it forces you to do 4x the work. 
=((

i guess that's it for the monster life autoclicker =((

346am

i think i spent 8 hours doing this =((

i want to cry =(((((((((((

thank you for watching.
