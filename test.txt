ok. hi youtube. 

so we are doing a night walker lazy rotation.. 

so let's start up our bot.. 

no actually, just head over to our nightwalker.py classfile. 

first, let's add an entry. 

now, let's write our custom rotation!

this is what our NW rotation will looks like:

ok. basically, 

we want to spam bite at that location, 
jump down, use portal (yes this bot can use portal precisely and efficiently), 
jump down, plant fountain, press the shadow skill to go back to the previous spot, 
jump left, loot, jump all the way right, press the shadows skill again to go back, 

yeah, that is our rotation. 

let's start coding. 

ok first, we need to know what is the x,y of that spot. 

ok i make the drawing better. 

now let's continue. 

there are 4 portals. 

then we want to stand directly above the btm left portal to spam bite. 

ok. now we code. 

first we code the bite. 

you need to code/change to your key setting. 

my bite key is 's'. 

just checking is the sp() and sr() function exist already. 

now we need to add a timer. 

we will rewrite the post_perform_action in this rotation. 

because it is special. 

yes we  want to press random button. leave that on. 

delete replace ropeconnect we don't need that. 

we don't need to plant cosmic shower. delete. 

we need fountain. 

we need rune. 

now add a bite timer. 

bitetimer0, bitetimer, bite are new variables, add them at the top of the file. 

just search fountaintimer0, and add that above it. 

here. in the init function. 

ctrl+alt+up/down to select multi line. 

ctrl+shift+left/right to highlight. 

esc to reset. 

now we have our bitetimer, we add that in our rotation. 

check the self.bite flag, enter the if case, perform spambite action, turn the flag to False, reset bitetimer0. 

perf_counter() simply return current system time. idk. it works anyway. 

if bite on cd, we just do nothing. 

maybe sleep .2 seconds. 

ok this part is pretty much done. 

next we want to jump down twice and enter the portal. 

for that we need a timer, a timer to countdown fountain replant. 

we have that already, our fountain timer. 

so we just use that. 

and then when we at ground platform, we want to enter portal. 

i will explain the gotoportal algorithm in seperate video, cause it's too long and too complicated. 

ok now we have successfully entered portal, 

we want to go plant fountain. 

we will appear at y=28.5 after entering btm left portal. 

check in action.py if we have implemented cp() cr()

yea

alright, now we want to do loot rotation. 

we can just continue from after planting fountain. 

press  down left between 222ms and 333ms (random)

good to have sleep(.1) after flash jump to wait for the landing. 

i forgot how steadfast shadow work, i will adjust later

ok now we done our looting rotation. 

look our nightwalker rotation, very simple, 782-759, 24 lines of code. 

because we go back, and we go loot, we spent about 10 seconds there. so we minus that. 

ok, our rotation is complete, now if our character is not at all the listen x,y in the tree, we just go back to our spot. 

this will not work, because your character will keep jumping and jumping. 

we need to walk. 

essentially means if x > 85.5 and x <= 88.5, 

this is the power of tree. you can plug in value anywhere XD. 

ok. pretty much DONE EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!

50 MINUTES!!! 

ok i will showcase the bot, then i will explain the use portal algorithm in the next video. thank you for watching.
