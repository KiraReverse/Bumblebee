hello youtube. 

there are two sleep function in my bot. 

time.sleep()

and

await sleep()

what is the diff????

time.sleep() is from the python 'time' library. 

await sleep() is a busy loop i write here. 

it is just a yea busy loo. 

in fact the async await is not even needed. 

but why is it there??

because i lazy to delete. 

because there is too many lines of code in the bot that uses await sleep()
so if i delete 1, i have to delete all. and i am lazy. 

now, let me show you what is the differrence in terms of performance. 

it is very important in botting because, you need very accurate actions/sequence at attacks. 

ok. i have three sleep function here. 

let's run. 


first, time.sleep(.001)

so according to its definition, the python time.sleep sleeps for at least .001 seconds, then wake up at the next interrupt cycle, idk, something like that. 

but for busy loop, it's difference, let's take a look. 

yeah, it sleeps exactly .001 seconds. sometimes it is not. like thiss 1. 

but most of the time, it sleeps for whatever timing you ask him to sleep.  

but from my experience, is only up to 0.001 second, 

it is not as accurate if 0.0001 second. 

ok. 

but, what is the cons?

cpu intensive. 

busy loop is very cpu intensive. 

let's observe the task manager. 

7.0~8.0% cpu power

now time.sleep()

is less than 1%. 


so, conclusion, use await sleep() in your rotation, if the delay timing is important. 

otherwise, use time.sleep(). 

example in my code, in my custom rotation, i use all await sleep()


but in the main.py, i use time.sleep()

ok thank you for watching!
